### Intro to Colab
```
Getting started with Google Colab,
Google Colaboratory is a online notebook-like
coding environment that is wellsuited for machine learning
and data analysis.
So, in this week we learned all aboud Colab and different
functionalities on how to use it. And also, there were some
guidlines on how to import datasers from Kaggle and basic file operations

### Week 4 lab session
```
In this week, we trained basic operations like importing numpy,
define LEARNING_RATE and index_list. We defined the x_train and y_train.

### Week 5 Lab Session
```
In this lab session we learned about
•  What is Tensorflow
• Computational graph
• Variables, Constants and Placeholders in TensorFlow
• Tensorboard visualization
• tf.summary.scalar command
• tf.summary.histogram command

We learned that TensorFlow is a library based on Python that provides differen types of functionality for deep learning models,
Through lab session, we used VARIABLES, CONSTANTS, PLACEHOLDERS
and TensorFlow Visualizations, Tensorboard Vizualization
Tf.summary.scalar command, Tf.summary.scalar command
Tf.summary.histogram command,Tf.summary.histogram command

### Week 6 lab sessions 1,

```
In this week we covered about
• Linear Regression using TensorFlow
• Visualization of Linear Regression parameters using 
TensorFlow
• Digit Classification | Neural network to classify MNIST 
dataset using TensorFlow
We learned how to Invoke the dependencies,Define the parameters,
Creating the dataset of linear regression, Define the model that you are trying to predict, define the optimizer, 
implement the cost function and initialize the variables, To execute the graph
and Visualization of Linear Regression 
parameters using TensorFlow.
Digit Classification | Neural network to classify 
MNIST dataset using TensorFlow in this process we started firstly by importing 
 the necessary libraries and Import the MNIST dataset and store it in the variable.

### Week 6 lab session 2
```
In the session 2, we learned about
Image Denoising using Neural Network. The main main is, 
from Kaggle we downloded the Fashion mnist daatset, in order
to avoid any bias, and creating dataset by adding a noise of 10, 
and then plotting them as an output

### Week7 lab session 1_1
```
Here, we import torchvision that can be used for torchvision transforms. 
And also DataLoader, we used matplotlib and Data loader to draw an image.
importing numpy will enable us to install the shape.

### Week 7 all activities
```
In this lab session we install requests, and 
imported it in order to get url.
Then we imported the torch library and many other 
that are needed to compile this project. 
Data will be loaded from Dataloader and also 
we ave the batch size here. 
And we defined trainset and testset so firt we 
downloded the files and verified.
